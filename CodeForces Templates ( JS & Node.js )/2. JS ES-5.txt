// Read the number of test cases
var x = readline();

// Variable to store input lines
var inp;

// Loop through each test case
for (var i = 0; i < x; i++) {
    // Read the input line and split it into an array
    inp = readline().split(" ");

    // Print the result (in Codeforces, this will be the output for each test case)
    print(inp.join(","));
}


Explanation:

Reading Inputs:

var x = readline(); reads the first line of input, which is expected to be the number of test cases or lines.

In a loop, inp = readline().split(" "); reads each subsequent line of input and splits it by spaces into an array.
Outputting Results:

print(inp.join(",")); outputs the array as a comma-separated string, suitable for Codeforces format.

Usage in Codeforces:

Copy and paste the above code into the Codeforces IDE.

Ensure your input matches the expected format (e.g., first line for the number of test cases, followed by input lines).

The print() function outputs results to the console, which Codeforces captures and evaluates.

This ES5 code should be compatible with Codeforces and meets the requirements outlined.
